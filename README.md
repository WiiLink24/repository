# repository
Edit `/etc/pacman.conf` or a similarly equivalent file, and add a new repository:
```
[wiilink24]
Server = https://repo.wiilink24.com/packages/
```


Under macOS, the dkp-pacman installation resides within `$DEVKITPRO/pacman`.

Should this domain go down, it should be additionally available from https://wiilink24.github.io/repository/.
